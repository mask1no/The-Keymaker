Server-only signing (no keys in web):
- apps/web relies on useDaemonWS and does not sign or store secrets.
- apps/daemon handles all signing/submission. Secrets loaded via keystore only.

Guardrails:
- Jito opt-in: jitoOk derived from HEALTH; Jito modes hidden in UI when unset.
- Defaults injected on TASK_CREATE from settings; prevents unsafe zero values.
- Idempotency: task-runner hashes serialized txs; duplicates return prior sigs.
- Kill switch + caps enforced before submit.
- Program allowlist invoked before submit.

Security headers:
- next.config.js sets CSP, XFO DENY, X-CTO, HSTS, referrer-policy, permissions.

No DB schema changes:
- All flags via settings table; new settings accessed with getSetting/setSetting.

Artifacts:
- Acceptance checklist in audit/ACCEPTANCE-CHECKLIST.md
- Env samples in apps/web/env.sample and apps/daemon/env.sample
- .gitignore/.dockerignore exclude sqlite and keystore
