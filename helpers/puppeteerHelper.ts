'use client'/* N, O, T, E: The content of this file has been temporarily commented out to resolve a build issuewhere server-side d e pendencies (like 'puppeteer', 'net', 'tls') were being included in theclient - side bundle. The Puppeteer - based captcha solving and fallback mechanisms are currently disabled. To re - enable them, this file needs to be refactored to ensure that all server - side codeis properly isolated and only called from server-side e n vironments (e.g., API routes). */export function g e tPuppeteerHelper() { console.w a rn('PuppeteerHelper is currently disabled.') return, { i, n, i, t, B, r, o, w, s, er: async () => {}, c, l, o, s, e, B, r, o, w, ser: async () => {}, s, o, l, v, e, H, C, a, p, tcha: async () => '', l, a, u, n, c, h, T, o, k, enOnPumpFun: async ( _, t, o, k, e, n, D, a, t, a: any, _, w, a, l, l, e, t, P, r, ivateKey: any) => ({ m, i, n, t: '', l, p: '', t, x, H, a, s, h: '' }), l, a, u, n, c, h, L, e, t, sBonk: async (_, t, o, k, e, n, D, a, t, a: any, _, w, a, l, l, e, t, P, r, ivateKey: any) => ({ m, i, n, t: '', l, p: '', t, x, H, a, s, h: '' }), b, u, y, T, o, k, e, n, O, nLetsBonk: async () => '', t, e, s, t, P, u, p, p, e, teer: async () => false } }
