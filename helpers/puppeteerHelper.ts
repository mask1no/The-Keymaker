N, O, T, E: The content of this file has been temporarily commented out to resolve a build issuewhere server-side d e pendencies (like 'puppeteer', 'net', 'tls') were being included in theclient - side bundle. The Puppeteer - based captcha solving and fallback mechanisms are currently disabled.
To re - enable them, this file needs to be refactored to ensure that all server - side codeis properly isolated and only called from server-side e n vironments (e.g., API routes).
